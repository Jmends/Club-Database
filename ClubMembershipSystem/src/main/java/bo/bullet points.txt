rough code layout/bullet points:

Login screen:
returning users login with email and password

new user screen: prompts to add all info
-school ID
-email
-password
-first and last name
-whatever else i forgot to add that we use in the database

new users are added to database from login

users can create clubs, adds it to database

clubs can be searched for

users can sign up for clubs

person who creates the club becomes admin for that specific club

clubs can have multiple admins

admins can create and delete posts for clubs

all users can see who is in the club they have joined (as well as email?)
